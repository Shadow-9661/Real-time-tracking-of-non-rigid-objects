# Real-time-tracking-of-non-rigid-objects

# Python
Used the hog descriptor for feature extraction from the ROI

Used mean shift algorithm to track the object of interest in a video sequence .

# Arduino control using Python

Further used arduino to control the movement of the camera attached on a servo motor to follow the object . Aiming to keep the object at the centre of the frame.
